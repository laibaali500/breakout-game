## How to play
Use the arrow keys to move the paddle left and right, so you can redirect the ball to hit the tiles and break them.
The aim of the game is to break all of the tiles and get a maximum of 80 points.
However, you will lose a life if you let the ball fall past the bottom of the screen! 
You only have 5 lives before you lose the game.
After the game ends, press space to play again.

## Bugs and Future Improvements
Bugs:
- Making the ball move at any angle: since the ball can only move at 45 degree angles, it sometimes becomes stuck in a loop and the player cannot finish the game.

Potential improvements and additions:
- Main menu: this makes the application more user-friendly, as it will not start immediately.
- Nickname and leaderboard features: could be stored temporarily, or permanently in a database.
- Settings screen: allows players to adjust sound and colour scheme settings, so the application is more user-friendly.
- Difficulty levels to select from at the beginning: so the game is easier for beginners and less boring for expert players.
- Multiplayer support: players can compete against each other, to make it more similar to the original version.
- Pause screen: to improve usability of the application.
- Increase ball speed as the game progresses: increases difficulty.
- Playing with multiple balls at once: increases difficulty.
- Allowing the paddle to be controlled with mouse position.
